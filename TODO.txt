TODO :
	Re-check leaks in case of malloc failure
	Function pointers casts validity ((void*)free_fn_ptr))
	Try breaking link only once per path
	Re-test your parser (commands) & overall time consumption impact
	Something messed up files, recheck norm
	Decide wether I should return 1 in case of error or not
	Importe more maps & check against another lemin
	Recheck leaks, norm and errors
	Check Makefile's libft re-compilation

SHOULD'VE :
	Implemented an 'error_logger' to record non fatal errors, avoiding some debugging trouble as occured with the 'duplicate_link.map'
	Reworked structures names and variables:
		t_anthill instead of graph
		anthill substructures : marks/flags/path/solution ?
		parsing specific structure ? (not. *last_command variable field)
	Renamed 'solution_to/from' to 'solution_prev/next'
	Handled pointers erasing better (affected files : 'room_utils.c, )
	Found a better file and srcs/ organization/structure
