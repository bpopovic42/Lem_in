FIXES :
Fix unprotected mallocs
ft_printf with no arguments segfaults (ft_printf("example %s and %s\n"))
fix makefile
remove ';;' from breaks
strange valgring leak report on 'sujet3' variations maps

TO CHECK :
check for segfaults and issues
re-check parsing isn't broken
integer overflows
libft's functions :
	ft_strlen, ft_strncmp
	hash, vectors and bitmaps

ADD :
Tester :
	average of time and lines as well as best and worst

REFACTORING :
Make data access functions ? (instead of (*(t_room**)) casts)
Make functions for comparisons (IF UNINITIALIZED OR SMALLER THAN instead of (!var || var < var2)
Rework structures names and variables:
	t_anthill instead of graph
	anthill substructures : marks/flags/path/solution ?
	parsing specific structure ? (not. *last_command variable field)
Decide wether to move bitmap functions to libft or not
Rename 'compute_solution' into 'record_selected_paths_if_better
