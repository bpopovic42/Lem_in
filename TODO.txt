I need a new separate structure containing all my paths and one containing all my end sets, currently the way sets are freed is causing is causing free issues (Calling set_free from ft_lstdel which then calls path_free which will try to entirely free paths), so I should have set_free function to remove duplicated pointers and paths should be freed at the end only from the 'all_paths' structure.
