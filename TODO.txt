1. Fixes list
2. Refactor (files, names, functions, see list below)
3. Norm
4. Final check for potential errors/leaks (see list below)
5. Optional : fine tune program, give a last look at the algo for any improvement,
	improve tester, make the repo nicer and add a description

FIXES :
fix makefile
remove ';;' from breaks
trying to read a folder doesn't work as expected
weird leak reports in valgrind on 'sujet3.map' variations (only at school)

TO CHECK :
check for segfaults and issues (get some maps from friends)
re-check parsing isn't broken
integer overflows
libft's functions :
	ft_strlen, ft_strncmp
	hash, vectors and bitmaps
Improve strcnpy function
Re-check leaks in case of malloc failure

REFACTORING :
Make data access functions ? (instead of (*(t_room**)) casts)
Make functions for comparisons (IF UNINITIALIZED OR SMALLER THAN instead of (!var || var < var2)
Rework structures names and variables:
	t_anthill instead of graph
	anthill substructures : marks/flags/path/solution ?
	parsing specific structure ? (not. *last_command variable field)
Rename 'compute_solution' into 'record_selected_paths_if_better
Rename 'solution_to/from' to 'solution_prev/next'
Handle pointers erasing better (affected files : 'room_utils.c, )

ADD :
Tester :
	average of time and lines as well as best and worst
