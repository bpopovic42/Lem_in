PROJECT STRUCTURE :
Import libft [DONE]
Create repository structure [DONE]
Create Project's Makefile [DONE]
Use a makefile rule to import libft instead of using a submodule [DONE]
Fix leaks from parse_command [DONE]
Test hash tables [WIP]
Clean code
Test and handle parsing error cases properly (auto unit testing with pre-defined error codes/msgs ?)
Record total number of links in order to handle case where no links are provided

PROJECT DESIGN :
1.
Create needed data structures and associated handling functions
Read and treat the input into previously created structures
Test the strength of resulting parser
2.
Implement DFS algorithm on your structures
Check if DFS's found paths are correct
3.
Determine the optimal way to send your ants with the given paths
Carefully check that every project's requirements are properly met
