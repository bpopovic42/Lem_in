1. Refactor (files, names, functions, see list below)
2. Norm (not. libft's files)
3. Final check for potential errors/leaks (see list below)
4. Optional : fine tune program, give a last look at the algo for any improvement,
	improve tester, make the repo nicer and add a description

FIX :
Maps in /problematic_maps

TO CHECK :
check for segfaults and issues (get some maps from friends)
integer overflows
libft's functions :
	ft_strlen, ft_strncmp
	hash, vectors and bitmaps
Improve strcnpy function
Check makefile's working properly
Re-check leaks in case of malloc failure
Function pointers casts validity ((void*)free_fn_ptr))

REFACTORING :
find_best_route.c 'break_link' handling (not normed)
Give a final look at the output process
Make functions for comparisons (IF UNINITIALIZED OR SMALLER THAN instead of (!var || var < var2)
Rework structures names and variables:
	t_anthill instead of graph
	anthill substructures : marks/flags/path/solution ?
	parsing specific structure ? (not. *last_command variable field)
Rename 'solution_to/from' to 'solution_prev/next'
Handle pointers erasing better (affected files : 'room_utils.c, )
Find a better srcs/ structure

ADD :
Tester :
	average of time and lines as well as best and worst
