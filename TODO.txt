PROJECT DESIGN :
1.
Create needed data structures and associated handling functions
Read and treat the input into previously created structures
Test the strength of resulting parser
2.
Implement DFS algorithm on your structures
Check if DFS's found paths are correct
3.
Determine the optimal way to send your ants with the given paths
Carefully check that every project's requirements are properly met
